### Possible reasons for lag in Shiny apllication:

    Poor performance of the server: If the server that is hosting the Shiny app is underpowered or overloaded, it may not be able to handle the load of the app and this may result in delays or lag.

    Heavy computations: If the app is performing heavy computations or complex data processing, this can also cause delays or lag. One way to reduce this is to use caching to store the results of the computations and re-use them as needed, rather than re-computing them every time the app is run.

    Large data: if the app has to handle large data, this can also slow down the performance of the app. A way to reduce this is to sample the data or to filter it before using it.

    Network traffic: If the app is hosted on a remote server and there is a lot of network traffic between the server and the client, this can also cause delays or lag.

    JavaScript execution: Shiny app heavily relies on JavaScript for communication and visualizations. If there is any issue with JavaScript execution or compatibility issue with the browser can cause delays.

    Debugging: If you have a lot of print statements or browser dev-tools open, it can cause delays as it is running a lot of extra code that may slow down the app.

### Troubleshooting leads:

    Profile the performance of the app using the profvis package to identify which parts of the app are taking the most time to run.
    Monitor the CPU and memory usage of the server to see if it is overloaded.
    Test the app on different networks or on different devices to see if the problem is related to network traffic.
    Try to reproduce the problem in a simplified version of the app, if possible.
    Run the app on different browser and see if there is any compatibility issue.
